Hello, my name is CJ Ramseyer.  I am a tech at heart, I love music, theatre, lights, sound, special effects, beer, coffee, and building my smart-home.
You will find my projects and my coding and smarthome journey here on my GitHub.

Questions are always welcome to start a discussion, solve an issue, suggest a solution to something, or improvements.
All I ask, is that they are kept respectful, constructive, and positive.  Anything less than that will be ignored, and deleted.

Welcome, and enjoy this journey with me
