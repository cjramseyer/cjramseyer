Hello, my name is CJ Ramseyer.  I have worked in IT since 1987 and I am currently a Solutions Architect for Semperis, focused on Identity Security.
I am also a tech at heart, I love music, theatre, lights, sound, special effects, beer, coffee, and building my smart-home.
You will find my projects, my coding, and my smarthome journey here on GitHub.

Questions are always welcome to start a discussion, solve an issue, suggest a solution to something, or improvements.
All I ask, is that they are kept respectful, constructive, and positive.  Anything less than that will be ignored, and deleted.

Welcome, and let's enjoy this journey together.
